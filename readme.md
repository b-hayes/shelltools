# Shell Tools

A large collection of command line tools I created for new PC setups and daily tasks.

Most tools are cross platform supporting: Debian Linux/MacOS/Windows:WS/Windows:git bash

## Setup

Run the following to add bin dir from this repo to your sysem path:

```
./bin/setup path
```

The setup command can also hep you install and configure common programs I use.

Run `setup` on with 0 arguments to see a list of what it can do.
